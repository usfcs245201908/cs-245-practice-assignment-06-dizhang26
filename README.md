# CS 245 (Spring 2019) Practice Assignment 06

I added throw Exception to two functions (clearData and isPalindrome) in Practice06Test.java, because otherwise my code won't run.
I did submit the assignment on time, and I only added comments after the due time. Hope it's not going to affect the grade. Thank you.
